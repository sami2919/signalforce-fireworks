> 👋 **You're looking at the `marops` branch.** It repoints the open-source [SignalForce](#built-on-signalforce--the-same-engine-repointed) signal engine at marketing operations. The `main` branch is the original signal-based prospecting toolkit. Everything below is why this branch exists — read it top to bottom, it's a five-minute story.

---

## The 30-second version

I forked SignalForce — a working, 547-test, config-driven GTM engine — into this `marops` branch and pointed it at **Conversion's platform**. Instead of a ranked list of prospects, the same pipeline now emits a **lifecycle campaign brief in Conversion's own data shape**: Salesforce + warehouse segmentation → a multi-touch sequence with non-overlapping execution / QA / optimization agents → optimization triggers → a pipeline projection with a downside scenario.

It is not a mockup. It is a deterministic generator: **YAML config in, schema-validated brief out.** Swap the config, get a different real-company brief in the same 30 seconds. There are five already built — including one for **Veriforce, an actual Conversion customer**.

```bash
git clone -b marops https://github.com/sami2919/SignalForce.git
cd SignalForce && pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Option A — generate live (needs an Anthropic key, ~$0.002, ~30s):
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
python3.11 -m scripts.marops.cli veriforce      # → out/veriforce.html

# Option B — no key, no wait: open a pre-generated brief in your browser:
open demo/veriforce.html
```

---

## What comes out

Every brief is generated to the **exact schema Conversion's platform consumes** — not approximated, encoded as a Claude `tool_use` JSON schema in [`scripts/marops/briefer.py`](scripts/marops/briefer.py) so the model physically cannot return an off-shape object:

| Conversion platform concept | What `marops` generates | Where it's enforced |
|---|---|---|
| **Segmentation** (SFDC + warehouse) | `salesforce_filters` in `SObject.Field__c` SOQL syntax, joined to `warehouse_traits`, with `exclusions` + `estimated_size` | schema `required`, validated by Pydantic |
| **Three-agent orchestration** | Each touch assigned to exactly one of `execution` / `qa` / `optimization` — *non-overlapping by construction* (execution owns sends, QA owns scoring/suppression, optimization owns variant selection) | `enum` constraint + system-prompt quality bar |
| **Multi-touch sequence** | 5 ordered touches, each with channel, timing, subject, body brief, personalization tokens, QA rules, success metric | schema `minItems`, per-touch `required` |
| **Optimization triggers** | `event → action` rules (intent spike, negative signal, renewal window) — actionable conditions, not observations | system-prompt quality bar #4 |
| **Pipeline projection** | Expected renewals, AE efficiency, runtime — **and a mandatory downside scenario** | system-prompt quality bar #5 |
| **"Why now" timing** | Signals decayed by recency → `HIGH` / `MEDIUM` / `LOW` timing tier + a **shelf-life-in-days** buying-window countdown | computed in `models.py`, not guessed by the model |

Open [`demo/veriforce.html`](demo/veriforce.html) to see one rendered. It reads like something a senior MarOps architect handed off — because the system prompt makes Claude *be* one, and the schema makes it prove the work.

## How it's built

```
examples/marops/<slug>.yaml          # ← the only thing you edit per prospect
        │  (Pydantic: MarOpsCampaignConfig.model_validate)
        ▼
scripts/marops/briefer.py            # Claude API call — claude-sonnet-4-6
        │  • tool_use with a strict JSON schema (output can't drift off-shape)
        │  • cached system block of "Conversion platform priors"
        │    → pay the cache-write once, read it on every later brief
        │    → steady-state cost ≈ $0.002 / brief
        ▼
scripts/marops/models.py             # LifecycleBrief — frozen Pydantic, re-validates
        │  • signal recency decay → timing tier + shelf-life days (deterministic)
        ▼
scripts/marops/renderer.py           # Jinja2 → out/<slug>.html  +  out/<slug>.json
```

Four small modules, one Jinja2 template, **zero new infrastructure** — it reuses SignalForce's Pydantic-everything, immutable-models, mock-every-HTTP-call discipline. Covered by **13 tests at ~85%** (`pytest tests/marops/`), part of the repo's **547 passing**.

**The design principle, stated plainly:** define the output shape crisply, let a schema enforce it, and iterate on *config* — never code. That's the same thesis the prospecting engine runs on, which is the whole point of the fork: it's not a one-off demo, it's a reusable architecture pointed at a new target.

## The example gallery

Five real-company briefs ship in [`examples/marops/`](examples/marops/) — each a different lifecycle motion, all from the same generator:

| Run | Company | Lifecycle motion | Why it's interesting |
|---|---|---|---|
| `veriforce` | **Veriforce** | Tier-2 supplier re-engagement (post-lapse → renewal) | An *actual Conversion customer*; dormant-ARR recovery play |
| `axonius` | **Axonius** | Pardot replacement → warehouse-native MAP | 3 stacked signals (Series E + Pardot G2 pain + live MOPs hire) |
| `vanta` | **Vanta** | HubSpot segmentation ceiling → warehouse-native MAP | Series D budget window + Snowflake-native audience pain |
| `hubspot-ceiling` | **Meridian Analytics** | Net-new acquisition before a conference window | ~6-day shelf life; buying committee modeled explicitly |
| `dbt-labs` | **dbt Labs** | Warehouse-native MAP adoption | PLG-to-enterprise lifecycle |

```bash
python3.11 -m scripts.marops.cli axonius      # or vanta, hubspot-ceiling, dbt-labs, veriforce
```

Want a sixth? Copy any YAML, change the prospect and the `why_now_signals`, run the CLI. No code touched.

## Built on SignalForce — the same engine, repointed

The reason this branch is credible is the engine underneath it. **SignalForce** (the `main` branch) is an open-source, config-driven GTM toolkit: it monitors public activity — GitHub repos, job postings, funding rounds, research papers, LinkedIn, G2 reviews — to find companies *actively* investing in a problem, then writes outreach referencing their real work. Every keyword, ICP tier, and scoring weight is YAML you control; the Python is a dumb collection layer; the reasoning lives in Claude.

`marops` keeps the spine — Pydantic models, immutable data, Claude integration, mock-every-HTTP testing — and swaps the renderer and the prompt. Same thrift, same discipline, new output. The rest of this README documents that parent engine; it's what makes the fork a five-minute exercise instead of a five-week one.

## Get Running in 2 Minutes

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/sami2919/SignalForce.git
cd SignalForce
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# 2. Configure your ICP (pick one):
#    Option A — Setup wizard (recommended):
#    Open Claude Code and run /setup
#    It asks what you sell and who you sell to, then generates everything.
#
#    Option B — Copy an example config for your vertical:
cp -r examples/rl-infrastructure/ config/
#    (also available: examples/cybersecurity/, examples/devtools/, examples/data-infra/)

# 3. Add your API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your GitHub token (required) + other API keys (optional)

# 4. Verify
pytest --tb=short -q   # 547 tests, should all pass
```

Open Claude Code and run `/signal-scanner` to find your first target accounts.

## Your Weekly Workflow

Here's what a typical week looks like using SignalForce:

| When | What | Skill |
|------|------|-------|
| **Monday morning** | Scan for new signals across all sources | `/signal-scanner` |
| **Monday** | Research top 10 A-tier accounts | `/prospect-researcher` |
| **Tuesday** | Find verified contacts at qualified accounts | `/contact-finder` |
| **Tuesday** | Generate personalized outreach sequences | `/email-writer` or `/resource-offer` |
| **Wednesday** | Add LinkedIn touches to high-priority prospects | `/multi-channel-writer` |
| **Thursday** | Follow up on meetings from the week | `/meeting-followup` |
| **Friday** | Review pipeline metrics, plan next week | `/pipeline-tracker` |

Or set up the n8n workflows and let it run autonomously — signals detected at 7am, contacts enriched by 8am, sequences launched by 9am, every day.

## How It Works

Three decoupled layers move data from raw public signals to enrolled sequences and CRM deals.

```

**The Python scripts don't make decisions** — they collect raw signals from public APIs based on whatever keywords you configure. The Claude Code skills layer does the reasoning: intent scoring with configurable weights and recency decay, ICP fit grading, multi-source signal stacking, and contextual copywriting. Same scripts also power the n8n workflows — no code duplication between human-driven and automated paths.

## Configuration

Your target market, signal keywords, ICP tiers, and voice rules live in `config/`:

```
config/               # gitignored — your active config
├── config.yaml       # scanner keywords, scoring weights, ICP tier definitions
└── gtm-context.md    # product positioning, voice rules, qualification criteria
```

`config.yaml` controls what the scanners look for:

```yaml
company:
  name: "My Company"
  product: "What you sell in one line"
  category: "Your market category"

icp:
  tiers:
    - name: "Tier 1 — Enterprise"
      description: "Large orgs with dedicated teams"
      signals: ["large team", "Series B+"]
    - name: "Tier 2 — Mid-Market"
      description: "Growing companies building capability"
      signals: ["growing team", "Series A"]
  maturity_stages: ["EXPLORING", "BUILDING", "SCALING", "EMBEDDED"]
  target_titles: ["Head of Platform", "Staff Engineer", "VP Engineering"]

scanners:
  github:
    enabled: true
    module: scripts.scanners.github_scanner
    keywords: ["your-domain-keyword"]
    topics: ["your-github-topic"]
    libraries: ["key-library-1", "key-library-2"]
  arxiv:
    enabled: true
    module: scripts.scanners.arxiv_scanner
    queries: ["your research area", "related technique"]
  jobs:
    enabled: true
    module: scripts.scanners.job_scanner
    titles: ["Your Target Role 1", "Your Target Role 2"]
    skills: ["key-skill-1", "key-skill-2"]

scoring:
  intent_weights:   # higher = stronger buying signal
    github: 2.5
    arxiv: 3.0
    jobs: 2.0
    funding: 1.5
    linkedin: 3.0
```

`gtm-context.md` is a natural-language file loaded by every skill — it tells Claude about your product, your ICP, your voice rules, and your disqualification criteria.

See `config.example/` for a fully annotated reference configuration, or run `/setup` in Claude Code for a guided setup wizard.

### Environment Variables

All API keys live in `.env` (gitignored). Copy `.env.example` and fill in your keys. Only `GITHUB_TOKEN` is required to run the scanners. Enrichment and CRM keys can be added incrementally.

---

## Custom Scanners

SignalForce ships with six built-in scanners. You can add your own by implementing the scanner interface:

```python
# scripts/scanners/my_scanner.py
from datetime import datetime, UTC
from scripts.scanners.base import ScannerConfig, ScanResult, Signal, SignalStrength

def scan(config: ScannerConfig) -> ScanResult:
    """Fetch signals from your source and return typed results."""
    started = datetime.now(UTC)
    signals = []
    # ... your API calls using config.keywords here ...
    return ScanResult(
        scan_type="my_signal_type",
        started_at=started,
        completed_at=datetime.now(UTC),
        signals_found=signals,
        total_raw_results=len(signals),
        total_after_dedup=len(signals),
    )
```

Then register the module path in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
scanners:
  my_source:
    enabled: true
    module: scripts.scanners.my_scanner
    keywords: ["what-to-search-for"]
```

The scanner runner picks it up automatically — works in both Claude Code skills and n8n workflows.

## Start Free, Scale When Ready

You don't need to pay for anything to start finding target accounts. Add paid tools incrementally as you scale.

**$0/month — Signal detection + account research:**
| What you get | Tool | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub repo scanning | GitHub API | Free (personal access token) |
| Research paper tracking | Semantic Scholar | Free (rate-limited) |
| Model upload detection | HuggingFace Hub | Free (public API) |
| Intent scoring + ranking | SignalForce engine | Free (open source) |
| ICP config + skills | Claude Code | Free ([Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) is free to use) |

This gives you: ranked target accounts with real buying signals, ICP scoring, and the full skill-based research workflow. You can look up contacts manually on LinkedIn and send emails from your own inbox.

**~$60/month — Add email sequencing:**
| What you add | Tool | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Automated email sequences | Instantly.ai | $37/mo |
| CRM deal tracking | HubSpot | Free tier |
| Workflow automation | n8n (self-hosted) | Free |
| Email copy generation | Claude API | ~$10-20/mo |

**~$200/month — Full automation:**
| What you add | Tool | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Contact enrichment | Apollo.io | $49/mo (or free tier: 50/mo) |
| Email verification | ZeroBounce | $16/mo |
| Backup enrichment | Hunter.io / Prospeo | ~$50/mo |
| n8n Cloud (no self-hosting) | n8n | $24/mo |

Start with the free tier. Run `/signal-scanner` and `/prospect-researcher` for a week. If the signals are good, add Instantly for sequencing. Add enrichment APIs when manual contact lookup becomes the bottleneck.

## Results

Target metrics at steady state (Month 3):

| Metric | Target | Industry Median |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Open rate | 45–65% | 20–30% |
| Reply rate | 12–20% | 3–5% |
| Positive reply rate | 5–8% | 1–2% |
| Meetings booked/month | 15–30 | — |
| Cost per meeting | $25–50 | — |

Signal-based outreach targets 12–20% reply rate because every email references a specific, recent, real action the prospect took — not a static list attribute.

See [`docs/results-framework.md`](docs/results-framework.md) for full metric definitions, monthly ramp targets, and diagnostic playbooks.

---

## Cost

| Tier | Monthly Cost | Sequences/Week |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Minimal | ~$61–81 | 10–20 |
| Standard | ~$206–226 | 80–150 |
| Premium | ~$670–740 | 150+ |

The Minimal tier runs on n8n Cloud ($24/mo) + Instantly.ai ($37/mo) + Claude API (~$10–20/mo). All signal scanners use free APIs. See [`docs/cost-analysis.md`](docs/cost-analysis.md) for a tool-by-tool breakdown.

---

## Contributing

See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for full system design documentation.

**Adding a new scanner:** Implement `scan(ScannerConfig) -> ScanResult` in `scripts/scanners/`, add the module path to `config.yaml`, add tests mocking all HTTP calls.

**Adding a new skill:** Create `skills/your-skill/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`). The `description` must start with "Use when..." — this is how Claude selects the right skill.

**Code conventions:** Pydantic models with `frozen=True` for all data structures. Type hints required. Ruff for formatting (`ruff format . && ruff check . --fix`). 80% minimum test coverage.
